# first-challenge-git

I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause

I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Teach pokemon to understand
The power that inside

POKEMON!!!
Gotta catch 'em all!
It's you and me
I know it's my destiny

POKEMON!!!
You're my best friend
In the world we must defend

POKEMON!!!
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through

You teach me and I'll teach you
POKEMON!!!
Gotta catch 'em all!
Gotta catch 'em all!
POKEMON!!!!!!
